# INDEPENDENT-COMPONENT-ANALAYSIS-FOR-IOT-SERVICES
•Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset, typically
to two or three dimensions, for visualization purposes.
•PCA relies on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), a matrix factorization technique, to
decompose the data into its constituent components.
•Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is used to decompose a multivariate signal into
subcomponents, allowing the separation of different contributing sources.
•A blind signal is a type of signal that can be analyzed using ICA, where the sources are
unknown or unobserved.
•In the context of brain signals, the contributions from different sources are referred to as source
signals.
•Humans can collect the necessary data from source signals using ICA, which enables the
separation and analysis of individual components.
•The primary sources of information that humans can perceive are through sight, hearing, and
experience.
•Oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin can be measured using the source signals obtained from
the brain. A low pass filter can be applied to differentiate the heart rate signals.
